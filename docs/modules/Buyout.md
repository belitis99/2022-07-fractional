## Buyout

Module contract for vaults to hold buyout pools
- A fractional owner starts an auction for a vault by depositing any amount of ether and fractional tokens into a pool.
- During the proposal period (2 days) users can sell their fractional tokens into the pool for ether.
- During the rejection period (4 days) users can buy fractional tokens from the pool with ether.
- If a pool has more than 51% of the total supply after 4 days, the buyout is successful and the proposer
  gains access to withdraw the underlying assets (ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens) from the vault.
  Otherwise the buyout is considered unsuccessful and a new one may then begin.
- NOTE: A vault may only have one active buyout at any given time.
- buyoutPrice = (ethDeposit * 100) / (100 - ((fractionDeposit * 100) / totalSupply))
- buyoutShare = (tokenBalance * ethBalance) / (totalSupply + tokenBalance)
